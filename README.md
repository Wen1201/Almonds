I created this web application for my second individual project for General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. We were tasked to create a CRUD system using everything we had learnt in the last 5 weeks about front and back end web development. We were given about a week to create a functioning application complete with Models (at least 3), Views, Controllers, Gems and site deployment (Heroku).
This website is for people to discuss movies and share their thoughts about movies.
